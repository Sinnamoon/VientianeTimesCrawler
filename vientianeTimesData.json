    "article": "ates grand Lao New Year, signalling tourism recoveryMillions of people countrywide joyfully celebrated the Lao New Year 2566 as the festivities returned with great fanfare following three years of restrictions because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The official festival took place over three days during April 14-16, though the celebrations in some places lasted longer.President Thongloun Sisoulith lights candles to honour Buddha images at Vat Ongteu in Vientiane.In Vientiane, President Thongloun Sisoulith led the public in paying homage to Buddha statues from a shrine at Ongteu temple, which were placed at a specially prepared spot where people could pour scented water on them and wish for luck. There were similar rituals in temples countrywide, with sacred Buddha images placed at special locations where people could pour water on them throughout the three-day festival.In the northern world heritage site of Luang Prabang, Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone led the official opening ceremony, kicking off the country’s biggest festive event at the well-known tourism hotspot.The annual festival, the longest public holiday in Laos, provides an opportunity for families to get together with relatives and friends for joyful activities such as parties. People spray water on each other and extend reciprocal best wishes.As in the period before the onset of the pandemic, millions of Lao nationals and foreigners took to the streets and joined water festivals, especially in the main cities, from Luang Prabang to Vientiane, Khammuan, Savannakhet and Pakxe, throwing water on each other and passersby.Such spraying of water, according to traditional belief, washes away bad things along with the outgoing year, and ushers in good luck throughout the incoming year.During the three-day festivities, members of the younger generation organised Somma, a traditional practice during which children and youngsters ask for forgiveness from their parents and elders for any inappropriate things they may have done over the past year, and extend good wishes to the elders.As usual, Luang Prabang hosted the  biggest festivities, with events taking place during April 12-17, the longest celebration.The first day saw the opening of a street fair and the start of the Miss Nang Sangkhane competition.The second day began with a procession of elephants that made its way from Mai Souvannaphoumaram temple to Xiengthong temple, watched by about 1,000 people. Prime Minister Dr Sonexay Siphandone and his wife sprinkle water during the parade of monks and novices in Luang Prabang as part of the Lao New Year celebrations.The following day, crowds flocked to the morning market fair, and in the afternoon, they headed to the banks of the Mekong river to build sand stupas.Luang Prabang’s festivities included a series of parades featuring the traditional Pou Yer Yar Yer characters, Nang Sangkhan, and traditional Lao dances.The colourful parades were organised over two days, with the first proceeding from Mai Souvannaphoumaram temple to Xiengthong temple and returning to starting point the following day.Officials said 2,600 participants joined 47 processions, including more than 300 monks from important temples. Their presence meant that devotees brought water containing flower petals to sprinkle on the monks as a blessing. They did this in the hope of receiving good fortune in return.The festivities ended on Monday, when the revered Phra Bang Buddha statue was taken in a colourful procession from the former Royal Palace to Mai Souvannaphoumaram temple, where the public poured water over the statue in an act of cleansing and renewal. This is the only occasion in the year when the Phra Bang is removed from its normal resting place, and Buddha images at all temples are returned to their usual resting places after the new year.By Patithin Phetmeuangphuan (Latest Update April 19, 2023)",

    "title": "Historic cross-border passenger trains travel between Vientiane and Kunming",
    "article": "-border passenger trains travel between Vientiane and KunmingThe first train (named Lane Xang) making a direct journey from Vientiane to Kunming in China on the Laos-China railway left the Lao capital on Thursday morning.The launch of the direct cross-border service took place in Vientiane and at the Boten border checkpoint in Luang Namtha province, attended by Minister of Information, Culture and Tourism, Mrs Suanesavanh Vignaket, deputy ministers and other guests.Speaking at the ceremony, Mrs Suanesavanh said “Today’s ceremony is an important historical event in the cooperation between the governments ofMinister of Information, Culture and Tourism, Mrs Suanesavanh Vignaket, officials and guests on Thursday attend a ceremony to mark the start of cross-border passenger trains between Laos and China.Laos and China, which always encourage and help each other to bring strength and prosperity to their countries.The first train to run between Vientiane and Kunming in China marks a great leap forward in the provision of transport links and the promotion of tourism, she said.The Laos-China railway is a cooperation project that has the full support of the leaders of the two government and is a symbol of Laos-China friendship in the modern era.The railway constitutes a strategic part of the Lao government’s plan to transform the landlocked country into a land link within the region, helping to fulfil the dreams and aspirations of the Lao people for greater regional integration.This railway was built as part of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative instigated by China’s President Xi Jinping.“Both our countries must continue to strive to achieve high-quality development and continuously upgrade our cooperation to take it to a higher level,” Mrs Suanesavanh said.The aim of the Lao government is to turn the Laos-China railway into an economic corridor that generates substantial income for Laos, helping to ease the current woeful economic situation and bring more foreign tourists to the country.The railway serves to raise the profile of Laos in the international arena, by integrating passenger transport services with those of neighbouring countries and strengthening Laos’ tourism links with countries in the region and beyond.The vital transport link provided by the railway has the potential to place Laos at the centre of efforts to more closely link Asean countries to China.Following the lifting of Covid-related travel restrictions, countries around the world have set programmes in motion to revive their economies, especially by promoting tourism, with a particular focus on visitors from China, who have the greatest purchasing power.In 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the following year, more than one million Chinese tourists came to Laos, accounting for 21 percent of the total number of visitors.Last year, even though the Chinese government had yet to open its borders for outbound tourism, more than 45,000 Chinese tourists came to Laos from third countries.“The high-speed train link between Laos and China offers huge potential for the growth of international travel. Today is a landmark occasion in pursuit of this goal as Laos and China jointly launch a high-speed cross-border passenger train service connecting Vientiane to Kunming, enabling many more tourists to visit the two countries,” Mrs Suanesavanh said.The minister also attended a send-off ceremony for the first passengers making the direct journey from Laos to China and welcomed passengers arriving in Laos on the train from China.The journey between Vientiane and Kunming covers a distance of 1,035 kilometres, stopping at eight stations, with a total travel time of 10 hours and 30 minutes. This includes the time taken to go through immigration at the Boten-Bohan border crossing.Rail operators in both countries began selling tickets for seats on cross-border trains at 8am on April 11.A first-class seat on the EMU train from Vientiane to Kunming costs 1,901,000 kip, while a second-class ticket is priced at 1,192,000 kip.Two trains will run each day, with one departing from Vientiane and the other leaving from Kunming.Train No. D887 will depart Kunming South Station at 7:08am (Lao time) and arrive in Vientiane at 5:38pm on the same day.In the other direction, Train No. D888 will depart Vientiane at 8:08am (Lao time) and arrive at Kunming South Station at 6:38pm on the same day.Passengers travelling from Kunming to Vientiane must get off the train with their belongings when it reaches the border at Mohan in China. They will then undergo document checks at immigration booths.After the checks have been completed, passengers can reboard the train and continue their journey.When the train arrives on the other side of the border at Boten in Laos, passengers must again get off the train with their belongings for a second immigration check.Passengers whose final destination is Boten can leave the station at this point, while passengers travelling to other stations in Laos can continue their journey.Each immigration check will take about 90 minutes, meaning the total time taken to complete exit and entry procedures in both China and Laos is about three hours in total. By Times Reporters (Latest Update April 19, 2023)",

    "title": "Lao Jinshi Faculty international training course ends",
    "article": "ulty international training course endsTrainees from Laos recently completed a course on mine geology and vocational skills under an international training course held at the Jinshi Faculty at the Kunming Metallurgy College in China.During the course, they learnt about operations at an open-pit iron mine in Panzhihualanjian China, the Bingham Canyon mine in the United States, and the Taotona gold mine in South Africa. They learnt about endogenous deposits, exogenous deposits, metamorphic deposits and supernatural deposits.Following the course closing ceremony, representatives of Kunming Metallurgy College, National University of Laos, and the Lan-Mekong China Education Training Promotion Alliance pose for a group photo with trainees.Kunming Metallurgy College, the National University of Laos and the Lan-Mekong China Education Training Promotion Alliance jointly held a closing ceremony of the “Lao Jinshi Faculty” at the Kunming Metallurgy College on April 10.Ms Ladthida Chaleunsouk and Mr Phet Xaiyavong, who were among the trainees, said they had learnt how to assess basic topography using contour maps, as well as prospecting technology methods and information extraction and synthesis as explained by Mr Zhou Ye.They also learnt how to assess the presence of minerals by identifying geological characteristics such as mineral outcrops and the purification degree of useful mineral heavy sand, and to evaluate and grade the ore targets.During the site exploration period, they learnt that it is necessary to take the largest ore body as the main exploration object, use landmark characteristics as the basis for exploration, take into account the professional knowledge of identifying other ore bodies, and cover the contents of intelligent mining of mines, non-ferrous metallurgy, intelligent processing of metals, dust removal and environmental protection, safety laws and regulations and mineral processing.The trainees indicated that the information provided was very useful in practice and expressed their appreciation of the opportunities provided by the Kunming Metallurgy College to learn from other countries.Head of the Department of Metallurgy and Minerals at the National University of Laos, Mr Soulisack Visaiphone, praised the success of the international training course at the Lao Jinshi Faculty. He expressed his gratitude to all the administrators, classroom lecturers and their assistants who had worked hard to ensure the course was beneficial.The Kunming Metallurgy College arranged industry-leading and comprehensive theoretically rich courses, so that everyone had the opportunity to learn professional knowledge in the field of metallurgy and minerals and broaden their horizons.Concepts had been improved and practical applications enriched and updated.Since the first anniversary of the opening of the China-Laos Railway, various business opportunities between China and Laos have continued to arise.Mr Soulisack said he hoped the Kunming Metallurgy College would be able to provide more useful training and in-depth cooperation in the future, and provide more advanced and practical knowledge to trainees. This would enable them to seamlessly connect and enter the workforce after graduation.Also speaking at the event, Vice President of the Kunming Metallurgy College, Gao Qionghua, said that since the start of the “Laos Jinshi Faculty Training” project at the college on December 2, 2022, two online “Jinshi Faculty Training” courses had been completed, training nine teachers, while two phases of training over a total of 12 days had involved 2,000 participants.The Kunming Metallurgy College has advanced teaching equipment and distance teaching resources and the college management has an international forward-looking vision. In addition, the college has a professional and superb teaching team with international Chinese teaching qualifications and rich experience and strength in carrying out training in Chinese as a foreign language and professional skills, Ms Gao said.In recent years, the school has been led by the School of Metallurgy and Mining to promote a series of international technical skills training programmes, with outstanding success.A series of professional courses has been set up around the mining, selection, metallurgy and handicraft production process of non-ferrous metals.The graduation ceremony was a further embodiment of the school’s metallurgical and mining school going further in carrying out international technical skills personnel training, Ms. Gao said.In the next step, the school hopes to continue to promote cooperation, relying on the basis of the Jinshi Faculty, in the near future.This will involve the school’s teachers going to Laos, organising offline training for enterprise staff to enhance their technical skills, and further fulfilling the stated intention to build a community with a shared future between China and Laos.This would be done by providing training for technicians in Laos and creating a “going out” service platform for enterprises. The main aim is to comprehensively deepen the school-running mechanism of joint construction and sharing between schools and enterprises specialising in metallurgy, contribute to the metallurgical expertise in the development of mines in Laos, and truly implement the “Belt and Road” initiative.Vice President of the Kunming Metallurgy College, Gao Qionghua; Vice President of the Kunming Metallurgy College, Xu Zheng; Director of the Foreign Cooperation and Exchange Office, Zhang Jiangmei; Deputy Dean of the School of Metallurgy and Mining, Song Qunling; Head of the Department of Metallurgy and Mining at the National University of Laos, Mr Soulisack Visaiphone; Head of the Geology Section, Dr Banthasith Vongphouthone; Head of the Mining Section, Mr Vongsavanh Soyouvanh; Secretary-General of the Lan-Mekong China Education Training Promotion Alliance, Fei Cui; Project Director of the International Exchange Department at the Lan-Mekong China Education Training Promotion Alliance, Cheng Yuying; lecturers, translators and student representatives attended the meeting.The meeting was chaired by Zhang Jiangmei, who is Director of the Foreign Cooperation and Exchanges Department at the Kunming Metallurgy College. By Advertorial Desk (Latest Update April 19, 2023)",

    "title": "The Legend of Lao New Year",
    "article": "Sangkhan parade in Luang Prabang city.The Legend of Lao New YearPi Mai Lao (Lao New Year) is the biggest festival held in Laos and officially takes place over three days in the middle of April, but not many people know the origins of this popular festival.The Abbot of Sikhounvieng temple (Dongmieng) in Chanthabouly district, Vientiane, Phra Archan Bounthavy Komphaphanh, shed some light on the story behind the celebrations and the customs that we preserve and hold dear today.Phra Archan Bounthavy Komphaphanh, explains the legend behind the Lao New Year celebrations.He recounted a long story, beginning with a rich couple who had enormous wealth but no children.One day a drunk man came to their house and shouted “Hey, it can be good to be rich, but if you have no children your life is meaningless because when you die there is no one to inherit all the money you have saved, so it is wasted.”The couple didn’t get angry or scold him because they knew that what he said was true.They were worried about what the future would hold, so they made offerings of flowers, incense, candles and other items to the sun, the moon, and the deities, hoping to have a son to inherit their wealth and perpetuate their family.One day in April, when the weather was very hot and most people spent time bathing in rivers to cool off, the rich man dressed up and led his people to perform a ritual to ask for a son from the angel that inhabited a special tree near the river.Soon afterwards, the rich man’s wife became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who they named Thammaban Koumman.The rich man built a small hut by the side of the river because he was happy to have a son. Every day, Thammaban Koumman liked to sit and play by the hut where many birds came to eat fruit. In addition to knowing the language of the birds, Thammaban Koumman learnt about the Hindu religion, and gained in-depth knowledge of astrology and linguistics.Whenever someone came to him with a question or a problem, whether related to religion or daily life, he was always able to provide an answer.Thammaban Koumman became famous and his name even became known in heaven. At that time there was a priest who was the lord of all gods and goddesses, named God Kabinlaphom. When he heard about the profound knowledge of Thammaban and the reputation he had earned, he descended to the human world to test his knowledge.God Kabinlaphom entered into an agreement with Thammaban.“If you cannot answer my three questions, I will cut off your head as a sacrifice to the teachings of Buddha. But if you can answer all three, I will cut off my head out of respect for your knowledge,” the god told him.The three questions were: where is the virtue of a person in the morning?; where is the virtue of a person at noon?; and where is the virtue of a person in the evening?The agreement was that Thammaban had seven days to answer these questions, at the end of which it would be decided which of them would lose their head.Revellers spray water over each other as part of the Lao New Year fun.Thammaban desperately sought to find the answers, but was unable to. Nowhere could he find a reference to a person’s “siri’’. Six days went by while he searched constantly, without stopping to rest, sleep, eat or drink.He was exhausted and reluctantly became resigned to the fact that the following day his head would be cut off. When it got dark, he clambered down from the seventh floor of the temple and walked into the woods.Unable to move further, he lay down and closed his eyes under a big tree.Then he realised there was a lively conversation taking place between two eagles in the branches above him.The male eagle told his wife that Thammaban Koumman would certainly lose the bet because the questions were very hard and no one in this world knew the answer except for the god who had asked them, and the eagle himself.The eagle’s wife was curious to know the answers to the questions and begged her husband to tell her. Without any hesitation, the husband gave her answers, which Thammaban heard and was able to understand because he knew the birds’ language.The following day, Thammaban and the God Kabinlaphom met as arranged and Thammaban proudly gave the answers to the god’s questions.“The virtue of person in the morning is in the face, because when a person wakes up they wash their face. At noon, the virtue of a person lies in the chest and the body, because a person pours water on their chest and bathes. In the evening, the virtue of a person is in the feet, because the feet are washed before a person goes to bed.”God Kabinlaphom was very surprised when Thammaban Koumman answered all the questions correctly, but he gracefully acknowledged his defeat by agreeing to cut off his head, as he had promised.But because the god’s head was holy, if it dropped on the ground it would cause a fire and burn down the whole world. If his head rose into the air, the land would become arid and parched and people would die, and if his head fell into the ocean, the world’s waters would dry up.So before cutting off his head, he asked his seven daughters to gather around and listen to his instructions.“My daughters,” he said, “after I cut off my head, take it and parade it around the earth’s axis 60 times, and then take it to Kay Rad Mountain. Each year, one of you must take turns to parade the head around the earth’s axis and bathe it with holy and perfumed water to show your respect, loyalty and gratitude to your father for bringing rain and prosperity to Earth.”When the god had finished speaking, he cut off his head and the seven princesses conducted a procession of their father’s head as he had instructed, after which they returned to heaven.This is the story of the birth of the Lao New Year celebrations and the Nang Sang Khan parade in particular. The seven daughters of God Kabinlaphom were born on each of the seven days of the festival, so each year the daughter whose birthday falls on the first day of the New Year will carry her father’s head and lead the grand parade.Today, everyone believes that by celebrating the New Year they will get rid of their bad luck and enter a time of good luck in the coming year.So they hold Baci ceremonies, pour water over their elders and other adults, and also pour water over Buddha images and each other, believing it will dispel misfortune, cleanse them, and allow them to start life anew.This year’s Nang Sangkhan represents the first Miss Mahasangkan (daughter of the God Kabinlaphom), named Kimitathevi. She wears gold and crystal adornments while carrying a lute in her left hand and a sword in her right as she sits atop a life size model of a buffalo. By Patithin Phetmeuangphuan (Latest Update April 19, 2023)",
